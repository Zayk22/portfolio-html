        <h2>Who is Azeez?</h2>
        <p>
            I am Azeez Olamilekan Adeleke, a dedicated web developer with a strong passion for building digital experiences. 
            I recently completed my studies in Software Engineering and have been honing my skills in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            My expertise includes front-end development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and experience in frameworks like React. 
            I also have a solid foundation in back-end development, working with databases and server-side scripting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond coding, I am a huge anime fan and love playing basketball. I also enjoy exploring new technologies, debugging challenging problems, 
            and collaborating on innovative projects. My passion for learning drives me to continuously improve my skills and stay up to date with industry trends.
